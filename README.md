The objective of this repository is to demonstrate the application developed to improve my knowledge about REST API using DDD modeling.

allowing CRUD to be carried out for the following operations:

-Instructors

Additionally, there is a dedicated endpoint for making registration payments.

## 📝 Notes
This project presents some areas that can be improved, and I am already working on them. For example, I'm creating a generic base interface to avoid repeating code. Additionally, I plan to implement JWT authentication soon.
